# Explaining Recommender Systems
## Year 4

**Project Introduction:** Recommendation Systems are the workhorse of most of the current web-based businesses. When buying something from Amazon, listening to music on Spotify, watching movies on Netflix, you're interacting with an intelligent recommendation systems. Developing efficient algorithms to recommend serendipitous items are one of the hot topics in this research field. The problem is that these algorithms are hard to understand, to explain how a recommendation was made.

The goal of this project is to develop a set of explanation techniques in order to better understand the outputs of recommendation systems, perhaps using visualisations. Using these techniques, we can understand the pros/cons of a specific algorithm in comparison to others.
