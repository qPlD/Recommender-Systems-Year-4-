The mnist2500_X.txt file contains 2500 (greyscale images of handwritten digits).

Each image is 28x28 pixels, therefore each line corresponds to an image an contains 748 values.

The mnist2500_labels.txt contains the label of the handwritten greyscale digit in the corresponding image.


MovieLens dataset:

Cannot be represented as a square matrix unless we add Null values.
This is because different users have not rated the same amount of movies (and vice-versa).

Can visualise movies grouped by ratings received(loss of information on who provided the ratings).
Can also visualise users by ratings given (loss of information on the rated movies).

Main concern is what we are going to cluster by, given the movielens dataset (users, movies, genres...).


tSNE:

The size of clusters means nothing.

Distances between clusters may not mean anything.

When iterating, always train until stabilisation.

Perplexity controls the effective number of neighbours.
