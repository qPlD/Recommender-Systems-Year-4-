User Study:


Preference acquisition:

Users can specify ratings for a minimum (set) number of movies within the collection.
The movies can be randomly selected for the user.

They can then be added to the data, or we can find the user that is most like them.

Can start with semi-structured interview.

Can gather further information on participants (age, gender, number of movies they watch).


Potential Questions:

1. How often do you use any of the following popular recommender systems: Youtube, Amazon, Spotify, Netflix...
Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Once a semester, Once a year, Never
Always, Often, Occasionally, Rarely, Never

2. Ask them to define what they think a good explanation should be, and if they think it is important to provide explanations for recommendations.

3. Ask users to rate each explanation interface (vary order between users to account for learning effects).

4. Can ask users to rate items before and after explanation to measure the effect of the explanation.
Check if users take more or less time to rate an item before/after the explanation.
Find which interface is the most effective, transparent, efficient one (can use simple textual recommendations as a baseline) to gauge it's overall performance.

5. Can ask for user's satisfaction and trust with the explanation method (compared to baseline).
