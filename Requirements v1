Project Requirements:

" Different people have different ideas of requirements. 
For a product owner, requirement is as simple as the ability to use/sell the product that helps with the business and revenues.
For a project manager working on that solution, requirements are to get the solution developed with best quality that meets all the expectations of the client and minimize resource allocation to bring most benefits to the company. For a team lead, 
requirements are to identify the technical challenges, build a maintainable architecture and get the solution developed smoothly. For a developer, requirements are to develop the assigned feature or make changes in the software as requested.

Requirements, at first glance are really needs (end objective), wants, suggestions or ideas. Derived from those needs, 
we set an objective and take a decision about what things should be done or not to be done to achieve that objective. "

same output given same input, accuracy in explaining recommendations).

* Should have:
- A UI to show the user why certain recommendations were made.

* Could have:
- Potential comparison feature on the performance of various recommender systems for a better understanding of the pros and cons (in explaining their results).
