Meeting Minutes 2:

- Potential tools & languages should focus on t-SNE and SpotLight (LightFM maybe later).

- Data-sets: Movielens is ideal to start with (matrix factorization).

- First iteration of the project should be done by the end of the final week of the first semester (16/12/19 - 22/12/19)

- Updated some requirements (content-based filtering, visualisation metrics).

- Remember t-SNE not an end in itself, main goal is to analyse recommendations (ie. tell the user which item from their ratings
has the biggest influence on the recommendation being made). This can be done through 'learning' (trying all combinations to
assess the utility of each item) or mathematically (finding most important factors).


To-Do:

- Start working with SpotLight.

- Use t-SNE to represent basic Movielens dataset: square matrix with 0 as no ratings. Labels could be ratings, but could
also be removed altogether (and focus the visualisation on a specific user rather than the entire dataset). 

- Consider matrix factorization (transforms sparse ratings matrix to dense matrix).

- Read about BPR & other tools (see email).

- email project and meeting plan before-hand.
