Meeting Minutes 4:

- Main tools: tSNE, SpotLight.

- Potential tools: LightFM, tensorboardrd.

- Data-sets: Movielens is ideal to start with (matrix factorization).

- First iteration of the project should be done by the end of the final week of the first semester (16/12/19 - 22/12/19)

Notes:

- Remember t-SNE not an end in itself, main goal is to analyse recommendations (ie. tell the user which item from their ratings
has the biggest influence on the recommendation being made). This can be done through 'learning' (trying all combinations to
assess the utility of each item) or mathematically (finding most important factors).

- Can model matrix after a single user (for implicit feedback) as we assume that user values items with which he has interacted
more than other items (obtain a matrix with +/-).

- Reduction operates from sparse user by items matrix (sparse) to a users by latent factors matrix (dense) and a corresponding
items by latent facors matrix (can be multiplied to find the original matrix).


To-Do:

- Make tSNE visualisation for a specific user rather than general representation (using item or user latent factors).

- Add labels to visualisation (starting with one label per movie).

- Produce screenshots of final results with different parameters (ie. perplexity).

- email project and meeting plan before-hand.
