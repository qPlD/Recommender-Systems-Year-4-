Meeting Minutes 22:

Dissertation:

DONE: Section 2.1.2: move tf idf formulae to appendice

- Section 2.3 - Do you clearly summarise WHAT you want us to take forward. How you differentiate from these previous works?
There was also a paper in the RecSys lecture on explanations on MovieLens - can you cite that and position yourself to that?
Talk more about what has been done & what you did.

DONE: Chapter 3 - please number the requirements, so you can refer back to them later.

- Chapter summaries should link the current chapter to the next chapter
(e.g. Section 4.6 is a case in point. - it should say in the next chapter, we describe how we implement these functionalities)

- "in Listing5.1 is a" check you always have spaces before \ref{}. I prefer Listing~\ref{} etc, to force a space but not one that permits a linebreak.
5.1 listing not very interesting > Put in Appendice > Possibly find more challenging code extract.

DONE: In Evaluation, add table synthesizing all results.

- Add abbreviations for common words.

- Fix Log issues.

- Re-read and agree on standards for \emph and \textbf as well as \\ for line breaks.

- Reduce to 40 pages.

- Do and cite accordingly appendices with entire interview, (intro & debrief), formulae, all additional graphs...

- Potentially put part 5.5 and 5.6 in chapter 4


Presentation:

- Summarise each section in the slides.
- Each slide has punchline/ buzzword / main message (possibly aided by visualisations).
