Meeting Minutes 13:

- Main tools: tSNE, SpotLight.

- Potential tools: LightFM, tensorboardrd.

- Data-sets: Movielens is ideal to start with (matrix factorization).

- First iteration of the project should be done by the end of the final week of the first semester (16/12/19 - 22/12/19)

Notes:

- Remember t-SNE not an end in itself, main goal is to analyse recommendations (ie. tell the user which item from their ratings
has the biggest influence on the recommendation being made). This can be done through 'learning' (trying all combinations to
assess the utility of each item) or mathematically (finding most important factors).

- Can model matrix after a single user (for implicit feedback) as we assume that user values items with which he has interacted
more than other items (obtain a matrix with +/-).

- Reduction operates from sparse user by items matrix (sparse) to a users by latent factors matrix (dense) and a corresponding
items by latent facors matrix (can be multiplied to find the original matrix).

- Movie genres not clustering may be normal in some cases (other possible explanations for user recommendations).

- The 7 main criterias when explaining recommendations: transparency, scrutability, efficiency, effectiveness, persuasiveness, satisfaction and trust.
Other metrics for explanation are Promotion (convincing a user) and Satisfaction (after having followed explanations).

- Final thesis: mention overfitting problem with graphs (RMSE evolution) and how it was solved.


To-Do:

- Showing the evolution of the model as it trains (create individual interaction object):
	Call fit() on a specific user data point (try both for partial data or entire data associated to this user's data point).
	Fit() the model with only one specific genre and interpret visualisations.
	Feed only 1 movie to the model for each iteration (and visualise user variations after each new movie is added).

- Explanation methods (neighbours' ratings, past performance accuracy of system, similar to other items in user's profile): 
	Link new predictions for user i to highest rated past movies of that user.
	Find users that are close (latent factors) to user i to make recommendations based on their tastes.
	
- Start devising basic approach to conduct user study (questions). Start thinking about design of study (see related paper).
	For example considering different kind of explanations techniques and comparing them. How will users take part (either pick user with
	ID that ressembles them, or create new user and provide ratings for movie within DB - possibly with drop-down menu.
	
- Start designing wireframes for user input for study (id or related, movie selection or giving ratings...).

- In recommendations of movies, can add a link to movielens page or page of movie alongside name (see Amir's email for leads).

- Find way to extract ratings for a precise user in order to provide explanation (ie. ratings of neighbours, past ratings of user...).

- email project and meeting plan before-hand.

=== (Low Priority) ===

- Try to find a user with similar tastes as you to see effectiveness of recommendations.

- Search for tSNE multi-label representation.
