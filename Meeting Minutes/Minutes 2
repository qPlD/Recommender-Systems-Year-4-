To-Do:

- Read about T-Sne, Movielens, SpotLight and start working on a basic visualisation.

- Read further papers on existing research as sources(identify what could be expanded on).

- Rework some of the requirements (ie. UI to must).

- Rework code evaluation techniques (survey, comparisons with and without recommendations...).
