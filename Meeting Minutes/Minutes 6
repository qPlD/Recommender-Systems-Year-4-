Meeting Minutes 6:

- Main tools: tSNE, SpotLight.

- Potential tools: LightFM, tensorboardrd.

- Data-sets: Movielens is ideal to start with (matrix factorization).

- First iteration of the project should be done by the end of the final week of the first semester (16/12/19 - 22/12/19)

Notes:

- Remember t-SNE not an end in itself, main goal is to analyse recommendations (ie. tell the user which item from their ratings
has the biggest influence on the recommendation being made). This can be done through 'learning' (trying all combinations to
assess the utility of each item) or mathematically (finding most important factors).

- Can model matrix after a single user (for implicit feedback) as we assume that user values items with which he has interacted
more than other items (obtain a matrix with +/-).

- Reduction operates from sparse user by items matrix (sparse) to a users by latent factors matrix (dense) and a corresponding
items by latent facors matrix (can be multiplied to find the original matrix).


To-Do:

- Show closest/farthest points to a single user (maybe zooming in or highlighting).

- Tweak tSNE dimensions settings (ie. displaying in 3D instead of 2D and making sure original dimension is the number of columns).

- For single-label representation: try removing movies with no labels & only representing movies with a single-label.

- Show evolution of a single user as the model trains (different graphs at time t). Call .fit() on a specific user data point (try both for partial data
or entire data associated to this user's data point). Try to find a user with similar tastes as you to see effectiveness of recommendations.

- Understand how model performs (is it overfitting to some data?). Could try to feed it a single genre first (before the others) to test for overfitting.

- Search for tSNE multi-label representation.

- email project and meeting plan before-hand.
