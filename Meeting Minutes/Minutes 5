Meeting Minutes 5:

- Main tools: tSNE, SpotLight.

- Potential tools: LightFM, tensorboardrd.

- Data-sets: Movielens is ideal to start with (matrix factorization).

- First iteration of the project should be done by the end of the final week of the first semester (16/12/19 - 22/12/19)

Notes:

- Remember t-SNE not an end in itself, main goal is to analyse recommendations (ie. tell the user which item from their ratings
has the biggest influence on the recommendation being made). This can be done through 'learning' (trying all combinations to
assess the utility of each item) or mathematically (finding most important factors).

- Can model matrix after a single user (for implicit feedback) as we assume that user values items with which he has interacted
more than other items (obtain a matrix with +/-).

- Reduction operates from sparse user by items matrix (sparse) to a users by latent factors matrix (dense) and a corresponding
items by latent facors matrix (can be multiplied to find the original matrix).


To-Do:

- Make tSNE visualisation for a specific user: add user latent factors (for a user i) to items by latent factors matrix.

- Add labels to visualisation: ignore items with no associated ID within the CSV file (add them independently). Start with single label (vary choice method?).

- Produce screenshots of labelling and single user representations.

- Find way to show evolution of a single user while the model is training (ie. representing that user as a point overtime, with nearby clusters).

- email project and meeting plan before-hand.
